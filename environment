#### Better less hadling
#-I: ignore case when searching
#-F: quit immediately when the entire file fits in one screen (in effect, mimic cat’s behavior)
#-R: enable colored output (for example, when piping to less from diff --color=always)
#-S: truncate long lines instead of wrapping them to the next line
#-X: don’t clear screen on exit
export LESS="IFRSX"
