My dotfiles

## .screenrc 

My old screenrc opens three bash shells (current user) plus adds hardline with important information:
* hostname
* each screen name 
* date
* time
* nickname "c++" ;-)

## aliases 

Aliases and functions to use lt, ..., odd :
* ls -alt (first the newest files)
* ... for cd ../.. 
* odd for better looking od 
* lsofi for better network lsof 

Either copy or link the aliases into your ~/.alias file and call it from .bashrc or .zshrc:
```
[ -f ~/.aliases ] && source ~/.aliases
```
 
## resolv.conf

Free and usable DNS servers
